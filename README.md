#Project Summary:
Machine learning and computer vision have important applications in the recognition of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset, which consists of a sizable collection of annotated photographs of handwritten digits, is the main focus of this research. With the use of this dataset, we were able to reliably identify and categorize scanned pictures of handwritten numerals.
#Installation:
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
Python 3 (version 3.6 or above)
NumPy
TensorFlow
Keras
You can install these dependencies using the following command:
              pip install numpy tensorflow keras
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
              git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
#Usage:
1.Open the project directory on your local machine.

2.Use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform handwritten digit recognition.

3.If using the Jupyter Notebook, launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:
              jupyter notebook
Open the notebook file handwritten_digit_recognition.ipynb in your browser and follow the instructions within the notebook to perform recognition.
4.If using the Python script, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command:
              python handwritten_digit_recognition.py
Follow the command-line instructions to provide the path to the scanned image of the handwritten digit you want to recognize.
5.The system will process the input image and display the recognized digit.
#Dataset:
The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains a training set of 60,000 labeled examples and a test set of 10,000 labeled examples.
The dataset consists of grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels. Each image represents a handwritten digit from 0 to 9, and the corresponding label specifies the correct digit.
#Model Training:
The model is trained using a neural network architecture. Neural networks are powerful models capable of learning complex patterns in data. In this project, the neural network is trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.
During training, the model learns to map the input images to their corresponding labels. This process involves forward propagation, where the input image is passed through the network, and backpropagation, where the model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual labels.
#Evaluation:
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using a separate test set from the MNIST dataset. The evaluation provides insights into the model's accuracy and its ability to generalize to unseen data.
The evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, are used to assess the model's performance. The higher the accuracy, the better the model is at recognizing handwritten digits.
